              Now that the weather’s settled into sunshine (or as settled as it ever gets in the UK!), it’s time to announce my
              summer
              reading list! Just like my Spring Reading List, and my #julietslibrarybookclub before that, this summer reading list
              is
              fully focused on reading books by diverse authors, encouraging us to learn from different perspectives and appreciate
              a
              wider variety of books.
            
              I’m really keen for these books to be super accessible for everyone, without you having to spend a shed load of money
              on
              a hardback, so I’ve got a mixture of new releases and new-to-paperback books in this list. Definitely check out these
              titles and I hope at least one of them piques your interest! <br> <br>
            
              Dominicana by Angie Cruz <br> <br>
            
            
              Fifteen-year-old Ana Canción never dreamed of moving to America, the way the girls she grew up with in the Dominican
              countryside did. But when Juan Ruiz proposes and promises to take her to New York City, even though he is twice her
              age
              and there is no love between them, she says yes. Their marriage is an opportunity for her entire close-knit family to
              eventually immigrate. So on New Year's Day, 1965, Ana leaves behind everything she knows and becomes Ana Ruiz, a wife
              confined to a cold six-floor walk-up in Washington Heights. Documenting her new life in the Big Apple, Dominicana is a
              vital portrait of the immigrant experience and the timeless coming-of-age story of a young woman finding her voice in
              the world.
